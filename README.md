## Description of the game
Tetris is a puzzle game in which the player must place the pieces that fall from the top of the screen to create full rows (lines), cleaning the line of blocks.
The player wins if they clear the number of lines that the level specifies.
The player loses if enough pieces pile up to reach the top of the playfield.
