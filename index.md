## About Us

We are Quokka Games Studios, a group of students of the bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development from CITM, and this is our first project: a tribute to the Tetris created by Atari in 1988.

## Description of the game

Tetris is one of the most unique and popular games in history, categorized as a puzzle title, in which the player must place the pieces(tetrominoes) that fall from the top of the screen to create full rows (lines), cleaning lines of blocks. The player wins if they clear the number of lines that the level specifies. The player loses if enough tetrominoes pile up to reach the top of the playfield.

Upon completing each level, the difficulty of the challenge raises, increasing the number of lines that the player must clear, or adding new gimmicks such as: some blocks already placed on the playfield, lines of blocks slowly build up amongst many more challenges.
